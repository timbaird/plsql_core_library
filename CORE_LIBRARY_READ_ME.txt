WARRANTY & SUPPORT
#################################

This work / library is offered without warranty either express of implied.

It is a condition of use of this library that both the original author,

Support is not provided.


#################################
INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
#################################

The library comes with an installation script called INSTALLER.sql 

To use INSTALLER.sql its reference to the file system must be maintained.

This means you need to either:
a. open it though the IDE (e.g. SQL Developer) File menu
OR
b. drag and drop it into the IDE (if the IDE supports this)

DO NOT open the installer script, and copy paste the script from a text editor into your IDE 
as it will lose its reference to its place in the file system and not function correctly.

Once it is open in your IDE run the script and it will install the core library procedures and functions to your database.
